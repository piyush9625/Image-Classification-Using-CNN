# Image-Classification-using-CNN
 This is the Kaggle dataset for Image classification of Dog and Cat. i have considered 5000 images out of 25000 image. Data is manually been divided as 4000 image of each class in training and 1000 image as testing.
 
 I am building 2 convolution layer neural network with image augmentation of 5000 Image for each cat and dog class and then making new prediction for 2 images.
